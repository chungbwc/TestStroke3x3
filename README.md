There is a database of 1000 Chinese characters written in cursive script style. Each character is maintained as a 3 x 3 grid of vectors showing the overall brush stroke flow within each cell of the grid. Users can write on the left hand side of the screen. The live writing will be encoded in the same 3 x 3 flow grid and matched with the closest character using the K Nearest function in OpenCV.


The program depends on

Processing 3.1.2
OpenCV 3.1.0 (Java built)
